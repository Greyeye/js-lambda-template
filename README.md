## NOTES 
1. CORS is not implemented. Extending the route and method to handle PUT/POST will result in error.
2. Github Actions can perform Terraform Deployment, make sure you setup github secrets with AWS IAM access key and secret keys.
3. Do not **FORK**, clone the repo. If you fork, you will not be able to set the repo as private.
